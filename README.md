# Bachelorthesis 2022

This repository contains all code for my Bachelorthesis.
The code is used to automatically train many neural networks with different parameters and then analyse the effects each parameter had on the performance of those trained networks.

The code can be found in the subfolder `programs/neural net testing program`. How to use the program is explained in the `README` file there.
