This folder contains the experiment results. The two `.zip` folders `bachelor_thesis_param_study_fastcAdam.zip` and `bachelor_thesis_adam_variants.zip` contain all trained models as well as the generated files showing the results of the analysis.
The folders `bachelor_thesis_parameter_study_chem` and `bachelor_thesis_pstudy_mnist_2` only contain the result files and a file `study_parameters.md` specifying the parameter settings used. The remaining files (trained neural networks) are not included, since those are several gigabytes of data. When requested I can also try to find a way of sharing those.
